00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.330
I just said that at its core, Git is a

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.690
map. That means that it's a table with

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.355
keys and values. What are the keys, and

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:11.050
what are the values? Well, the values are

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.530
just sequences of bytes. For example, the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.132
content of a text file or even a binary

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.970
file. Any sequence of bytes can be a

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.590
value. You can give a value to Git, and it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.650
will calculate a key for it, a hash. Git

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.740
calculates hashes with the "Shawn"

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.900
algorithm. It's Sâ€‘Hâ€‘Aâ€‘1, "Shawn" for

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.040
friends. Every piece of content has its

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.820
own SHAâ€‘1. For example, let's take a piece

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.510
of content, the string "Apple Pie." If you

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.970
ask Git to generate a SHAâ€‘1 out of this

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.930
string, then you will get this hash,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.950
exactly this one. There is only one hash

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.445
for this string. SHAâ€‘1s are 20 bytes in

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:52.830
hexadecimal format, so they are a sequence

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.330
of 40 hex digits. This will be Git's key

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.700
to store this content in the map. We can

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.680
also calculate the SHAâ€‘1 on the command

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.340
line. To do this, we need a command that

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.510
you might never have heard about because

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.950
it's a lowâ€‘level plumbing command, git

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.310
hashâ€‘object. So let's pass our piece of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.160
content to hashâ€‘object. I wish I could do

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.860
it like this. It would be easy, but I

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.770
can't. Hashâ€‘object is not very user

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.940
friendly. It's a plumbing command. So if

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.120
you do what I just did, Git will think

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.990
that "Apple Pie" is the name of a file.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.080
Instead, I can use the echo command to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.060
output this content and then pipe the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.730
result into hashâ€‘object like this. I also

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.660
need to tell hashâ€‘object to get its

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.230
content from standard input, not very

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.930
intuitive. If you're using Windows, then

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.580
you will use different shell commands. But

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.540
don't worry about doing this yourself

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.730
anyhow. It's enough that you understand

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.710
what this does. It brings out the hash for

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.530
this piece of content, and here is the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.290
result. This is the SHAâ€‘1 for the string

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.520
"Apple Pie." This is the same SHAâ€‘1 I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.669
showed you on the previous slide. We have

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.460
the same content, so we get the same

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.390
SHAâ€‘1. If you change anything in the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.990
content, a single letter for example, I

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.315
will add a new line character at the end

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:22.720
like this, then you get a completely

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.170
different SHAâ€‘1. Every object in a Git

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.510
repository has a SHAâ€‘1. If you put the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.990
string "Apple Pie" in the file and store

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.360
this file in Git, then the SHAâ€‘1 we just

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.090
generated will identify the file. And as

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.560
we'll see later, directories also have

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.565
their own SHAâ€‘1, as do commits, and so on.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.680
With so many SHAâ€‘1s around, you might

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.220
wonder what happens if they collide? After

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.470
all, the number of possible SHAâ€‘1s isâ€‘it's

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.360
large, sure, but it's not infinite. What

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.640
if I have two different pieces of content

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.990
and just by chance they happen to have the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.120
same SHAâ€‘1. Wouldn't that make a mess of

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.650
my project and cause me to lose my data?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.680
Well, yes, it would, but it's unlikely to

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.760
happen. Let's see just how unlikely it is,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.490
just because it's fun. Think of the US

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.390
Powerball lottery. How many chances do you

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.080
have of winning the lottery jackpot?

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.890
Google tells me that the chances that a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.980
particular combination of numbers wins the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.730
jackpot are about 1 in 175 million. This

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.630
is a large number, so let's try to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.010
visualize it. Imagine printing one ticket

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.160
for every possible combination of numbers

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.640
in the lottery. You get 175 million

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.710
tickets. Now imagine putting all those

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.650
tickets in a line, 1 every 25 centimeters.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.690
That's about 10 inches. That's a very long

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.350
line of tickets, long enough to span the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.330
entire equator. Now imagine starting

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.270
somewhere on the equator and taking a walk

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.120
around the world. It's a long walk and

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.098
also quite a bit of swimming, so it's

00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:08.170
going to take a while. And all across your

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.480
track, you're walking along this very long

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.080
line on lottery tickets, remember. And

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.870
just once during your trip you're allowed

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.579
to pick up a single ticket. And if you are

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.110
really lucky, that's the one ticket that

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.370
wins the jackpot. Congratulations. That's

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.320
how hard it is to win the jackpot. Now

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.040
imagine that you enjoyed winning the

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.540
jackpot, so you want to try it again. You

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.435
take a second trip around the world. You

00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:36.000
once again pick up a single ticket along

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.760
your way, and you win again. Now that's

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.290
really, really good luck. Winning the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.300
jackpot twice in a row is almost

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:46.730
miraculous, matter of fact. Now imagine

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.370
doing it a third time, and amazingly you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.740
win again. And again and again, six times

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.170
in a row. Now winning the jackpot six

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.560
times in a row is extremely unlikely, you

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.370
will agree. Well, going back to Git, these

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.480
are about the same chances of getting the

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.990
same SHAâ€‘1 for two different pieces of

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.880
content. It's just not likely to ever

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.470
happen to you or to anybody by chance. So

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.090
by all practical purposes, SHA1â€‘s are

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.450
unique. Not just the unique in your

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.640
project, you can think of them as if they

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.880
were unique in the universe. You could put

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.280
all of the data you will ever write in

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.760
your life in the same Git repository, and

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.700
Git would assign a different SHAâ€‘1 to each

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.650
version of each file in each folder.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.880
That's a lot of data. You might get some

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.630
performance problems, but still no

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.470
collisions. Later in this training when we

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.300
talk about distribution, this piece of

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.990
information will come useful. For now, I'm

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.580
only mentioning it to say: if you have

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.275
ever worried that two SHAâ€‘1s might collide

00:05:53.275 --> 00:05:56.040
in your Git project, then stop worrying
